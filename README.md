- 👋 Hi, I’m @YourFriendlyError
- Already know Python and RBX.lua (or just lua by itself). Do I consider myself a master? No. Though, I started in the programming world through HTML editing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ C#, anything C-related really. They may be more challenging than Python and Lua but I think they won't go anywhere anytime soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. Easy or intermediate. Please challenge me to the point where my brain malfunctions and I start to question my decesion getting into programming.
- 📫 How to reach me? Through Discord Christ#2060
